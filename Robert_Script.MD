Now, since we're up here telling stories. Let's talk a little about the outliers. One of these years is driven by fundamentally different economic forces than all the rest. In 2010, we all recall that the country was just beginning its recovery from the Great Recession.

Let's see if we can drill down into the dashboard and find out a little bit more about that recovery. I think the first thing that everyone will notice is that the unemployment rate stands out at 10 percent as shown in the KPI meter up here.

Let's drill down to see how that employment rate changes with each of the 5 industries that we're comparing.

If we look at each of these industries separately, we'll observe that by far the lowest unemployment rate at this time is in the Public Administration Segment. 95.72 percent of people who categorised their industry as "Public Administration" remained employed at the time. This category is comprised of general government, executive, legislation, and judicial services. It appears as though jobs in the Public Administration section are more resiliant to downturns in the economy.

Let's look at the educational distribution at this time. It appears that the Public Administration category has a preponderance of responders who have at least some college.

On the other hand, the worst performer in terms of employment rate at this time was in Manufacturing. In 2010, only 89.3 percent of people in the Manufacturing segement maintained their employment. This was a wide category, which included everything from food products, to textile and apparrel, to pharmaceutical, and to petrochemical manufacturing.

One thing to observe about the Manufacturing section is that it has the greatest proportion of people in the "High School or Less" category.

Now, we don't exactly have any definite indicators of causation. However, further analysis could possibley shed light on if the contributing factor is education or if it's the industry itself.
