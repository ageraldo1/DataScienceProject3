1. As part of an ongoing project on automation in the workforce, I have combined the automation probability data in my previous dataset with a breakdown of the number of jobs in each occupation by state. Automation Probability is from [Carl Benedikt Frey
and Michael A. Osborne
(http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf)and state employment data is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Note that for simplicity of analysis, all jobs where data was not available or there were less than 10 employees were marked as zero.
